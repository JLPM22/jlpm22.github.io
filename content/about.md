Hello! I am an **AI and Computer Graphics researcher** and recent Ph.D. graduate from [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en) Barcelona, focusing on **Generative AI for character animation**. I am currently a Postdoc at UPC.

My background spans academia, Big Tech, and startups. I recently developed AI-based motion stylization for the metaverse at **Meta Reality Labs** and built computer vision mocap pipelines for a Hyper, a **Y Combinator startup**.

My research is published in premier venues (**SIGGRAPH Asia, Eurographics, CHI**) and widely adopted by the community—from an open-source **Motion Matching** engine (500+ GitHub stars) to an educational Game Dev YouTube channel (120,000+ subscribers).
